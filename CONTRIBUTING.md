Let me keep this code-of-conduct relatively permissive:

At a project level, it doesn't matter who you are, whether you are black or white, male or female, LGBTQ+ or not, even if you are from North Korea, even though that might be illegal in the US.

However, please do not use this repo to train an AI model, contribute anything containing something made by AI, or anything else involving me and AI.
I have a fear of interacting with someone I think is human, only to find out it is really just a computer program.
Because of that, anything containing AI brings me anxiety and makes me uncomfortable, so I ask you to refrain from involving me in it.
This is not a bannable offense, but I want to avoid AI as much as I can, with the exception of my trying to reassure myself by trying to make ChatGPT do something I think it would be incapable of doing, only for it to be incapable of doing it to my standards, if it can do it at all.
Please respect that.
If you are going to contribute anything AI-generated, whether that be code or discussion, please annotate that you used AI for that, as AI has a few good uses, even if I don't like how the tool is used.

The only cases you are prohibited from contributing to this repo are:

1. You broke Github's ToS. Depending on the reason, you might be able to send patches via email.

2. You posted NSFW or something I consider NSFW on Github or some other site. That is disturbing for me to glaze my eyes upon, so I am banning you for my own sake.

3. I already blocked you for some other reason, or I feel it would be the right choice to block you.

You can always ask on IRC, Discord, or email why I blocked/banned you, unless you are trying to bait and cancel me.
Soon, I might make a repository detailing who I blocked+banned and why, but it isn't a priority.
