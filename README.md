# Narser, a Nix ARchive parSER library and program

NOTE: Not to be confused with the [Narser](https://github.com/Nacorpio/Narser) parser generator, which is 9 years old.
[narz](https://github.com/water-sucks/narz) is an alternative to narser, but doesn't export any modules and has an empty static library.

If you want to run the tests, first run `mkdir src/tests/empty`. TODO: Make it create an empty directory instead

## Todo

1. finish
